    "When ships pass through shallow water, they experience higher resistance due to changes in the viscous friction and the impact of squatting or sinkage in the water. These effects are due to the water passing under the ship being constricted and thus having a higher velocity. The change in velocity results in a difference in the buoyancy of the ship in accordance with the Bernoulli principle, which states that \n",

    "\n",
    "Where $P$ is pressure, $\\rho$ is water density, $v$ is the speed through water,  $g$ is gravity, and $h$ is the distance from the reference plane. As can be seen, an increase in water velocity must be balanced by a change in at least one of the other two variables. Changes in pressure result in the ship's buoyancy being reduced, causing it to sink slightly or squat. As the coefficient of friction experienced by the vessel is proportional to the square of the speed through water, the frictional resistance on the ship increases. A secondary effect is that the sinkage exposes an additional surface area of the ship to the water, increasing the friction effects further. Finally, as the ship's hull gets closer to the sea floor, the boundary layer between the hull and the free-flowing water thickens and becomes more turbulent increasing resistance. As a result of the additional resistance, the engine is required to deliver more power to maintain speed.\n",
