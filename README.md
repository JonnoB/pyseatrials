pyseatrials
================

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

This is a collection of functions that are useful for estimating ship
performance from sea trials data. The library is based on ITTC
Preparation, Conduct and Analysis of Speed/Power Trials.

Currently only appendix ‘E’ Correcting for wind has been implemented

The library is based on numpy and works with pandas

## N.B

This project is in early development. Function names and library
structure may have breaking changes at anytime

## Install

``` sh
pip install pyseatrials
```

## How to use

As an example here is the
[`law_of_cosines`](https://JonnoB.github.io/pyseatrials/trig.html#law_of_cosines)
from the `pyseatrials.trig` module.

``` python
import numpy as np
```

In the first case the law of cosines is applied to a right angle
triangle, simplifying it to pythagoras theorem

``` python
law_of_cosines(3,4, np.pi/2)
```

    5.0

In the second case the law of cosines in applied to $45^\circ$ or
$\frac{\pi}{2}$

``` python
law_of_cosines(3,4, np.pi/4)
```

# What still needs to be implemented

The following parts of ITTC need to be implemented as a minimum

- Appendix F
- Appendix G
- Appendix J
- kinamatic viscosity
- reynolds number
- Frictional resistance coefficient - ITTC 57
- Froude number
- roughness allowance
